## About me

Hello world👋. I am Gurlin Kaur, a junior Software Developer and a student based in Winnipeg, Canada.

I am basically from India and moved to Canada to pursue software development. I find joy in coding and listening to music.

My programming experience includes 💻 HTML, 🎨 CSS, and 🚀 JavaScript. I am planning to learn C#, React, advanced database concepts, and much more in my coding journey. I'm excited to explore new technologies and deepen my knowledge and become a professional developer.

- 📚 I’m currently studying software development at MITT, Winnipeg.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source/commercial projects.
- 🤝 Let's connect and share our coding journeys! Feel free to reach out.
